## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to intelligent systems that exhibit agency — they can:
- Perceive and interpret their environment
- Make decisions based on goals and context
- Take autonomous actions
- Learn and adapt over time

This repository showcases practical examples and experimental projects using Agentic AI principles in Python.
