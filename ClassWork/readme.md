# 🤖 Modern AI with Python – Classwork Project

Welcome to the **Modern AI Python Classwork** repository! This project explores cutting-edge AI techniques including autonomous agents, LLM integration, and tool-based reasoning, all implemented in Python.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn modern AI development with Python.
- Build autonomous agents that use reasoning and tools.
- Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT.
- Practice modular software design in AI systems.
- Explore memory, tool use, and task chaining in agents.

---

## 🧠 What is Modern AI?

Modern AI is not just about models — it's about **agents that can think, plan, and act**. Using LLMs, APIs, tools, and memory, agents can solve tasks more flexibly and intelligently than traditional systems.

Example capabilities:
- Search the web
- Use a calculator
- Access files or databases
- Remember context across tasks
